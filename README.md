- 👋 Hi, I’m @wphillips-eagent
- 👀 I’m interested in Java and React and making things work safe, fast, and with minimal maintenance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React patterns and message patterns, eAgent flow, and standards for Hot Files.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything!
- 📫 How to reach me - Slack is fastest, and more likely to get a reply outside of regular office hours than email.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love archery and have a takedown recurve bow with 35# and 50# limbs, but I'm terrible with both 🤣
